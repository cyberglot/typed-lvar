\begin{proof}
  By induction on the structure of $\seq{\ty{\Gamma}}{\ty{\Sigma}}{C}{T}$.
  \todo{%
    Examine each possible typing rule which could result in $\tm{C}$ being
    well-typed, and show that for each of them, either $\tm{C}$ can reduce, or
    it is a value.}
  \todo{%
    I~think it's easier to prove this \emph{directly} on $\rede$, since
    otherwise you'd have to give a statement of progress with a third case,
    which is that $\tm{C}$ is of the form $\tm{\config{\plug{E}{M}}{S}}$, where
    $\tm{\config{M}{S}}$ can reduce.}
  \todo{%
    This proof \emph{contains} the core of what used to be reflection, since we
    remove the error configuration and hence any term which would originally
    error would now be stuck, violating progress.}
\end{proof}
